This repository contains my personal website for MBDA 730, where I post course assignments and projects. The site is hosted with GitHub Pages.

Podcast Reflection:
The episode emphasized that a portfolio is most effective when it shows not only final results but also how you think and communicate. A personal website helps me organize assignments and projects in one place and makes it easy to share with employers or research contacts. Over time, it becomes a public record of growth that’s hard to capture in a resume alone.
